## Professional Experience

### Senior Software Engineer, myHQ
*April 2022 - Present*

#### Technical Leadership & System Architecture
* **Architected the technical vision** for a unified booking platform, enabling seamless integration with 20+ vendor systems and scaling to process 50,000+ monthly transactions. Implemented proactive health monitoring and automated recovery mechanisms, delivering a 95% reduction in booking failures and measurable improvement in customer satisfaction scores.
* **Spearheaded platform-wide optimization initiatives** by redesigning the listing, payments, and inventory subsystems—implementing geospatial search algorithms, real-time capacity management, and advanced availability optimization. These architectural enhancements established new performance benchmarks, achieving 40% faster search response times and improving operational efficiency across the organization.
* **Established cross-service architectural standards** for data access patterns, caching strategies, and rate limiting policies, driving adoption across 12+ microservices and elevating system consistency by 60% while reducing technical debt.

#### Infrastructure & DevOps Excellence
* **Pioneered zero-downtime deployment practices** by designing robust CI/CD pipelines with automated rollback capabilities and graceful shutdown procedures, enabling daily releases with 99.99% reliability and reducing deployment-related incidents by 60%.
* **Enhanced observability and system reliability** by implementing a comprehensive monitoring strategy—integrating Elastic APM, external service health checks, and real-time operational dashboards—empowering engineering teams to resolve production issues 30% faster and proactively identify system bottlenecks.
* **Architected resilient data infrastructure** with multi-region MongoDB replica sets, Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR), and automated backup/restore processes, ensuring 99.9% data availability and supporting regulatory compliance requirements. Led the implementation of nginx SSL termination for secure, scalable service delivery.

#### Security & Compliance Systems
* **Standardized security posture** across engineering teams by implementing unified authorization frameworks (CASL), enforcing end-to-end encryption protocols, and integrating AWS secrets management. Established RBAC policies and automated security patching, achieving a 99.8% compliance score and reducing security vulnerabilities by 90%.
* **Redesigned auditability and privacy systems** by architecting a centralized audit logging infrastructure with automated log scrubbing capabilities, enabling 4x faster root cause analysis and ensuring PII protection compliance with evolving data privacy regulations.

#### Engineering Culture & Mentorship
* **Established engineering culture excellence** by implementing code quality standards, leading architectural reviews, and mentoring 5+ engineers—directly contributing to a 25% reduction in production bugs and facilitating the promotion of 3 engineers to senior roles. Cultivated a culture of technical excellence and cross-functional collaboration.
